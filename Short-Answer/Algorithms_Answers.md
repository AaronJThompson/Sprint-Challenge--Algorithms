#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
O(n^3 - n^2)

b)
O(n*2^n)

c)
O(n)

## Exercise II

I would use a binary search method.
I start off at floor n/2
If the egg is broken, I got to the floor (current floor / 2)
else I got to floor (current floor + (current floot/2))
I repeat this proccess until I reach the floor
This has a time complexity of O(log n)
